# hotel-reservation-app

I created a hotel booking application using some of the most popular and powerful libraries for React.

You will learn:

- Integration and use of **React/TanStack Query** to manage queries and mutations.
- Global state with **Zustand**.
- Navigation with **Wouter**.
- Forms with **React Hooks Forms**.
- Notifications with **React Hot Toast**.
- Design and styles with **Material UI**.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
